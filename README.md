# Lending Protocol Simulation

A Monte Carlo simulation designed to study and determine optimal Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios for cryptocurrency leveraging in DeFi lending protocols. The simulation can be tweked to various market conditions and risk factors to help identify the most efficient and secure LTV settings for crypto-collateralized loans.

## Main File

The core simulation logic is implemented in `leverage_v2.py`

## Running the Simulation

To execute the simulation, run:

```bash
python leverage_v2.py
```
